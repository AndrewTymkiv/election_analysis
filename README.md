## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to perform an audit for the local congress election for the Colorado Board of Elections. In this audit, I analyzed the results data to determine the total number of votes for each candidate, the voter turnout for each county, and ultimately, the winner of the election. 
#### Audit Tasks
1. Calculate total votes in the entire election
2. Find and list the counties that were involved in the vote
3. Calculate the total votes per county and percentage of votes for each county
4. Determine the county that had the largest turnout
5. Find and list the names of all the candidates running in the election
6. Calculate the total votes for each candidate and the percentage of total votes they each received
7. Calculate which candidate won the election based on their total number and votes

## Election Audit Summary
The script used for this election audit is fairly straightforward and can be easily used for any election, small or large. If you ran this script for a different state, all you would nned to edit is the county names and the candidate names. If you were to run this for a federal election, you would once again change the candidate names, and then you would need to change the counties to states instead.
